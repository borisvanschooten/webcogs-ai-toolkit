# Docs for writing a plugin

A plugin is a module that can interact with the user via HTML widgets, or process information.  A plugin is always defined as a single export class, and should be written in vanilla Javascript. Do not assume any libraries are available.  For example jquery is not available.  The class constructor always has this signature: 
constructor(core, ...custom_params). Parameter "core" is the core object, which contains the core API functions.  The constructor can be any number of additional custom parameters.

The plugin class is constructed when the core app invokes the plugin, and can be destroyed and constructed any number of times during the app's lifecycle.

## Core functions

The following functions are available to all plugins, via the "core" object.

function core.mount(location, html_code, css_code) - Show a widget to the user by mounting the given HTML in a shadow DOM.  Returns the shadow root element, which should be used to query the HTML inside the widget.  It is possible for a plugin to have multiple widgets, or none.
core.mount has the following parameters:
- location - a string, indicating where to place the user interface element.  The complete set of available locations is defined in the section "available core.mount locations".  Use only these.
- html_code - a string with a HTML snippet that contains the user interface for the widget
- css_code - corresponding styling for html_code.  This should be a CSS snippet.  The \<style\> tag should not be included.

function core.route(route, ...custom_params) - Invoke the core router.
core.route has the following parameters:
- route - a string describing the route. The format of the route is defined in the section "core.route routes". Use only these.
- custom_params - there can be any number of custom parameters.

## Core properties

core.db is a SQLite compatible database object. It has the following functions: 
- async function db.run(sql_statement) - execute a SQL statement or query. Note this is an async function. If it is a query, returns an array of objects. Each object represents a record, with keys representing the column names and values the record values.
