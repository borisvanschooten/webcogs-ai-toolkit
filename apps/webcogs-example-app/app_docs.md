Use the classes, styles, and properties in the supplied CSS definitions as much as possible. Do not override the styles in the CSS classes you use, use them as-is.  You can assume they are available to any widgets you mount.

## General guidelines

Widgets should always display a title.

Form fields, labels, and buttons should be left-aligned.

Email form fields should be implemented using input type="email".

If showing an organization, always show the organisation name and not the organization ID.

Users should be shown like this: first_name surname (@username).

Ticket should be shown like this: Ticket #ticket_id.

This is a multilingual applicatiom. Run all literal strings / texts in the code and HTML through core.translate(). Do not write your own wrapper function, always call core.translate directly.
