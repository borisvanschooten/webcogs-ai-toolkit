Write a plugin that shows a single user in a table with two columns, keys left and values right. The user ID is passed as a custom parameter to the constructor.  Below the user table should be the list of tickets submitted by the user. When you click on a ticket, route to ticket_overview with the ticket ID as custom parameter. Below that is a list of tickets assigned to the user's organization.  Open tickets should be highlighted in both lists.
