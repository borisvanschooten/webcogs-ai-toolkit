Write a plugin that shows a particular ticket in the database. The ticket ID is passed as a custom parameter to the constructor.  All ticket fields except user ID should be shown in a table.  The user who issued the ticket should be shown in the table as well.  The ticket text should be shown in a large area.  All responses to this ticket should be shown below the ticket.  Show a button "Respond" below the responses which routes to ticket_response.
