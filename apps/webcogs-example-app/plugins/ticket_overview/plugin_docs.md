Write a plugin that shows a particular ticket in the database. All ticket fields except user ID should be shown in a table. The ticket text should be shown in a large area.  The user who issued the ticket should be shown in a table below the ticket. The ticket ID is passed as a custom parameter to the constructor. If the response_text is NULL, show a button "Respond" which routes to ticket_response.
