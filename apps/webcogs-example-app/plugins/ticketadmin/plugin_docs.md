Write a plugin that shows four lists showing tickets, one for each possible value of ticket status: open, in_progress, fixed, not_fixed.  Lists should be shown one below the other.  Highlight items that are assigned to the logged in user's organization.  Items in the lists should be descendingly ordered by date. The ticket text should be shown in a large area. Each ticket row should also show the username that issued the ticket, the organization name of the user, and the date. When you click on a ticket, it should route to "ticket_overview" with as parameter the ticket ID, except when you click on the user, which should route to "user_overview" with as parameter the user ID. Do not use jquery.
