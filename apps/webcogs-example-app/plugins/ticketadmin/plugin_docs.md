Write a plugin that shows four lists, one for each possible value of status: open, in_progress, fixed, not_fixed. Lists should be descendingly ordered by date. The ticket text should be shown in a large area. Each ticket row should also show the username that issued the ticket, and the date. When you click on a ticket, it should route to "ticket_overview" with as parameter the ticket ID, except when you click on the user, which should route to "user_overview" with as parameter the user ID. Do not use jquery.
