Write a plugin that shows a list of all tickets in the database, ordered by date. The ticket text should be shown in a large area.  Each ticket row should also show the username that issued the ticket, and the date. When you click on a ticket, it should route to "ticket_overview" with as parameter the ticket ID, except when you click on the user, which should route to "user_overview" with as parameter the user ID.
