Write a plugin that shows a list showing tickets. It has two additional constructor parameters: status and sort_order.  Status indicates which status to show; default is "open". Sort_order is one of: date, organization; default is "date".  Date sort order should sort the list descendingly.  Organization sort order refers to the organization a ticket is assigned to, with not assigned tickets at the top. If sort order is organization, order by date within each organisation, and show the name of the organization above the first item.

Above the list should be selectors for data and sort order.  If selected, route to ticketadmin with as parameters the selector values.

The ticket text should be shown in a large area. Each ticket row should also show the username that issued the ticket, the organization name of the user, the organization it was assigned to, and the date. Show an organization-avatar for the assigned to organization at the left of each ticket. Use organisation ID to cycle through the id-, id-2 variant classes. When you click on a ticket, it should route to "ticket_overview" with as parameter the ticket ID, except when you click on the user, which should route to "user_overview" with as parameter the user ID.
