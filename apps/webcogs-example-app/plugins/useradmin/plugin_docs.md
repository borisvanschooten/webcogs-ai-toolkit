Write a plugin that shows a list of all users in the database, and show all fields for each user, including organization name and role.  Users should be sorted by organization, then by surname.  There should be a title with the organization avatar and name above the users of each organization. Each item should be a block with the field names left and the values right. When you click on a user, it should route to "user_overview" with as parameter the user ID.
