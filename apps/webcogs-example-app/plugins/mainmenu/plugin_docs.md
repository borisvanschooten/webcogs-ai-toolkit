Write a plugin that shows the main menu, which is a horizontal area at the top.  The main menu has the following items, which should route to particular routes when clicked:

- Users - route to useradmin
- Tickets - route to ticketadmin

The menu item that is selected by the user should be highlighted.

At the right is a logout button that routes to logout.
