Write a plugin that shows the main menu, which is a horizontal area at the top.  The main menu has the following items, which should route to particular routes when clicked:

- Submit ticket - route to submit_ticket
- Tickets - route to ticketadmin
- Users - route to useradmin
- Stats - route to ticket_stats

The menu item that is selected by the user should be highlighted.

At the right, show:

- The logged in username. When you click on the username, route to user_profile
- a logout button that routes to logout.
